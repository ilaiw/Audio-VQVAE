# Audio-VQVAE

I needed to use only the VQVAE part of [OpenAI's Jukebox](https://github.com/openai/jukebox), so here it is, a simplified version of the VQVAE part, if anyone might need this. Have fun!

Check out the notebook [train.ipynb](https://github.com/ilaiw/Audio-VQVAE/blob/main/train.ipynb) to see the basic functionality and some quick results using a subset of the [NSynth dataset](https://magenta.tensorflow.org/datasets/nsynth).
